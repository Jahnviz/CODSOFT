# 🌸 Task 3 - Iris Flower Classification

### 📌 Problem Statement
Build a machine learning model that can classify Iris flowers into three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica  

based on their sepal and petal measurements.

### 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Iris Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset)
- Also available via seaborn (`sns.load_dataset('iris')`)

---

### 🛠️ Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading & Inspection** – Loaded Iris dataset.  
2. **EDA** – Visualized counts and relationships between features using pairplot.  
3. **Preprocessing** – Split into features (X) and target (y), applied scaling.  
4. **Model Training** – Used K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier.  
5. **Evaluation** – Measured accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

---

### ✅ Results
- Model achieved ~**95% accuracy**.  
- KNN classifier performed well in distinguishing all 3 classes.
