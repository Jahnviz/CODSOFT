# 💰 Task 4 - Sales Prediction

### 📌 Problem Statement
Build a machine learning model to predict **sales** based on advertising expenditure in different media (TV, Radio, Newspaper).  

---

### 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Sales Prediction Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ashydv/sales-prediction-simple-linear-regression/input)  
- Alternative: [Advertising Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ybifoundation/Dataset/main/Advertising.csv)

### 🛠️ Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading & Inspection** – Loaded dataset, checked structure.  
2. **EDA** – Visualized relationships, plotted heatmap of correlations.  
3. **Preprocessing** – Selected relevant features: TV, Radio, Newspaper.  
4. **Model Training** – Applied Linear Regression.  
5. **Evaluation** – Used Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.  
6. **Visualization** – Scatterplot of actual vs predicted sales.

---

### ✅ Results
- R² Score: ~**0.90** (shows strong predictive power).  
- Sales prediction depends most on **TV & Radio spend**, less on Newspaper.
